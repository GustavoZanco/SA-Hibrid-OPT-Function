Description: 
The SA hybrid optimization contains the code to apply the optimization technic based on the methodology of the simulated annealing. The search is a collar based approach in searching for the optimal drillhole sampling configuration based on different objective functions. Basically, the method will minimize the uncertainty derived from the sampling modeling, be it so kriged or simulated based, or both in the hybrid approach. The search for the optimum collars is made following the simulated annealing, i.e., with the possibility of acceptance of worse optimums while searching for the best results. In the search methodology the user can choose the domain limits, if the drillhole direction will be optimized too, the value that shall be associated with the samples while optimizing and the cooling schedule, be it slow or fast. To optimize the user shall create a “block data” object that contains the model of the original sampled data, be it kriged or simulated. The block data implements the “drillhole collar maker” that is essential to the optimization. In the code is presented too the 3 basic objective functions that are directly made, i.e., only utilizing one of the model types, kriged or simulated. The hybrid functions are implemented in the optimization algorithm and shall use both of models, with each receiving a weight value. Lastly, a simple algorithm to automatically make optimizations given an array of the collar number that the user desires is presented and a grid search that will make the optimization using a direct approach based on the domain limits and a step defined by the user, made to obtain the best possible drillhole collar (but only one collar per optimization). The sgsimxbin.for contains the code of the sigsim.exe of the Gslib, with the changes made for the proposed research, considerations of the convex hull when simulating nodes and the results be returned in binary format for faster computational time. The user must compile the sgsimxbin.for to attain the .exe file that will be used in the algorithm. The kt3d.exe, needed for the kriged based objective funtions, must be obtained by the user and can be found with the Gslib normal files.

Requirements:
Python 2.7.10
Gslib files (that shall be present in the folder of the sgsimxbin.exe and kt3d.exe)
